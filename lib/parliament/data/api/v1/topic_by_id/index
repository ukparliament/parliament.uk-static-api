Questions are usually the first item after Prayers. They last about an hour. There is no Question Time on Fridays.\n\nMost Question Times include:\n* Substantive questions, which are printed in the Order Paper. If you ask a substantive question, you will have to the opportunity to ask a supplementary question, which is not printed in the Order Paper and must be related to your original question\n* Topical questions, which are in a standard form (asking for a statement on the Minister's responsibilities) and which give you the opportunity to ask a spontaneous question on any aspect of the Department's responsibilities. Topical questions usually take place during the last 15 minutes of a Question Time. You can find out which Departments have topical questions by looking at the Questions Time rota." .
